The student life, professors, campus activities and day to day experiences have been vibrant, fun and helpful. The place where id like to see the most change is with the administration. With tuition hikes and the removal of the AAA scholarship, USC has been taking away from their accessibility initiatives and their focus and encouragement of pursuing double majors and minors. I hope to see change that shows students that the administration cares about the ability of all students to get the education that they want."}, {"rating": "Rating 5 out of 5 ", "text": "USC has been a very great experience both academically and socially.
